# Musical Dynamics Training Software for Digital Piano
## Description
Simple python program that helps pianists practice and visualize their dynamic expression in real time.

## Primary Use
While there are many programs that help learn to play piano or improve sight-reading, none have focused on practicing and fine-tuning dynamic expression.  This program provides a very simple user-interface to visualize your dynmics:
* Displays a colored bar extending above the piano key that denotes the velocity of each keypress
* Lists the level at which you are playing (pp, p, mp, etc.)
* Future feature to indicate how closely aligned simultaneous notes are played
